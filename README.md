# Challenge 1 Project

## Issue

The goal of this project was to edit the prexisiting HTML and CSS to make it more accessible to all users

### Changes Made 

HTML: I researched semantic code to make changes to prexisting HTML code. I was able to take out a lot of the repetitve "div" elements and replace them with better suiting elements. 

CSS: I consolidated classes with identical code to clean up the prexisitng CSS to make it more user friendly. I also added descriptive comments for each section and detailing in the comments the changes I made.
